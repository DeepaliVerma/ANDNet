## Dataset
<b><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iYf_hbpIIScubZBuUJhSQc5jDhsmYbdI?usp=sharing">RoadCaption Dataset</a> <b>

In the RoadCaption dataset, 10K images are collected, and the captions with constraints, like damaged, bumpy, crowded, and concrete, are described. Each image is annotated with an average of 5-7 captions. Moreover, the images and captions of UC Merced (UCM)-captions dataset [5] are also added to include the different viewpoints of road conditions.
